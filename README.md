# mongodb-d4

**D4** is an automated tool for a generating **d**istributed **d**ocument **d**atabase **d**esigns for applications
running on MongoDB. This tool specifically targets applications running highly concurrent workloads, and thus its
designs are tailored to the unique properties of large-scale, Web-based applications. It can also be used to assist
in porting MySQL-based applications to MongoDB.

Using a sample workload trace from a either a document-oriented or relational database application, **D4** will compute
the best a database design that optimizes the throughput and latency of a document DBMS. The three design elements that
D4 can select for an application are:

+ Sharding Keys
+ Indexes
+ Collection (De)normalization
