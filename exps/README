+ MongoDB Benchmark Framework                     +
+ ----------------------------------------------- +

This framework can run different sample workloads using MongoDB.
It was originally based on my TPC-C benchmark framework that I used
in my NoSQL course in spring 2011. It was then forked by one of my
students in the summer of 2011. I then grabbed his changes and modified
it further to support the different types of experiments that we will
need for this work.

TLDR:
This code is based on: https://github.com/yanglu/BigBenchmark
which was originally based on: https://github.com/apavlo/py-tpcc
