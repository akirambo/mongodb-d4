Cost Model object

Used to evaluate the "goodness" of a design in respect to a particular workload. The 
Cost Model uses Network Cost, Disk Cost, and Skew Cost functions (in addition to some
configurable coefficients) to determine the overall cost for a given design/workload
combination

collections : CollectionName -> Collection
workload : List of Sessions

config {
    'weight_network' : Network cost coefficient,
    'weight_disk' : Disk cost coefficient,
    'weight_skew' : Skew cost coefficient,
    'nodes' : Number of nodes in the Mongo DB instance,
    'max_memory' : Amount of memory per node in MB,
    'address_size' : Amount of memory required to index 1 document,
    'skew_intervals' : Number of intervals over which to calculate the skew costs
}

        # Outline:
        # + For each operation, we need to figure out what document(s) it's going
        #   to need to touch. From this we want to compute a unique hash signature
        #   for those document so that we can identify what node those documents
        #   reside on and whether those documents are in our working set memory.
        #
        # + For each node, we are going to have a single LRU buffer that simulates
        #   the working set for all collections and indexes in the database.
        #   Documents entries are going to be tagged based on whether they are
        #   part of an index or a collection.
        #
        # + Now when we iterate through each operation in our workload, we are
        #   going to need to first figure out what index (if any) it will need
        #   to use and how it will be used (i.e., equality look-up or range scan).
        #   We can then compute the hash for the look-up keys.
        #   If that key is in the LRU buffer, then we will update its entry's last
        #   accessed timestamp. If it's not, then we will increase the page hit
        #   counter and evict some other entry.
        #   After evaluating the target index, we will check whether the index
        #   covers the query. If it does, then we're done
        #   If not, then we need to compute hash for the "base" documents that it
        #   wants to access (i.e., in the collection). Then just as before, we
        #   will check whether its in our buffer, make an eviction if not, and
        #   update our page hit counter.
        #   There are several additional corner cases that we need to handle:
        #      INSERT/UPDATE: Check whether it's an upsert query
        #      INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: We assume that they're using a WAL and therefore
        #                            writing dirty pages is "free"
        #      UPDATE/DELETE: Check whether the "multi" flag is set to true, which will
        #                     tell us to stop the scan after the first matching document
        #                     is found.
        #
        # NOTE: We don't need to keep track of evicted tuples. It's either in the LRU buffer or not.
        # TODO: We may want to figure out how to estimate whether we are traversing
        #       indexes on the right-hand side of the tree. We could some preserve
