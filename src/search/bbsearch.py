'''
Usage:
1) Instantiate BBSearch object. The constructor takes these args:
* collections:  dictionary mapping collection names to possible shard keys
                example: collections = {"col1": ["shardkey1", "shardkey2"], "col2": ["id"], "col3": ["id"]}
* bounding function: f(BBDesign) --> (lower_bound, upper_bound), both float(0..1)
* timeout (in sec)

2) call solve()
That's it.

NOTE: BBDesign is the input for our COST FUNCTION.
All we care about is BBDesign.assignment, which is just a dictionary
mapping collections to tuples (shardKey, denorm),
where shardKey is obviously the field we'd shard on (or None)
and denorm is either None (no embedding) or the name of the enclosing collection 

A collection in BBDesign.assignment may map to None, which means
this assignment/solution is incomplete, i.e. this collection has not been assigned yet.

Example of BBDesign.assignment:
assigment: {'col2': ('id', 'col3'), 'col3': ('id', None), 'col1': None}
